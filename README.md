# Delhi-Metro-Route-Optimization

OVERVIEW:
This project calculates the optimal route in the Delhi Metro network using graph-based algorithms. It determines the shortest path between two stations and displays the sequence of stations, ensuring efficient travel planning.

FEATURES:
Shortest Route Calculation: Finds the most efficient path between two stations.

Graph-Based Algorithms: Uses algorithms like Dijkstra's for optimization.

Customizable Inputs: Allows users to enter source and destination stations.

Scalable Design: Can be extended to include real-time updates and additional metrics.
